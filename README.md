After 2-3 weeks, if considerable changes are made the version on the Unity Asset Store will also be updated.

## Description
Scriptable Dynamic Crosshair is aimed to speed up your development process in FPS games. This package simplifies the process of converting the crosshair into dynamic. It can easily be accessed and modified through any script.

Using this package, you can easily change the **SIZE** OR **COLOR** between two values in a single line of code. You can also **multiply** the size by any floating point number. The smoothing time can be set individually for size and color. The current size of the crosshair is also accessible, along with the targeted object, and the location of the hit point of the crosshair.

NOTE: The assets used in the sample scene of this project are taken from [3Dtextures.me](https://3dtextures.me/) and [Polyhaven](https://polyhaven.com/).

## Dependencies:
This sample given in this package uses the Unity input system and cinemachine. But Old Input System can also be used with this package without cinemachine. So overall you can say no dependencies.
